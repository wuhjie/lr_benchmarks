PAPERSEARCH_USER_PROMPT = """### User Query
{user_query}

### History Actions
{history_actions}

### Paper List
{paper_list}

### Instructions
Analyze the **Paper List** and **History Actions** to determine the next set of actions. Enclose your analysis of the state and decision logic within `<analysis>...</analysis>` tags.
**You support parallel tool calling.** You should output multiple tool calls in a single step if several independent actions are valuable at the current state.
**Attend to the history actions and avoid repeating the same search query or expanding the same paper.**

### Output Format
<analysis>
[Your analysis of the current state and decision logic...]
</analysis>
<tool_call>
[Tool call 1]
</tool_call>
<tool_call>
[Tool call 2]
</tool_call>
